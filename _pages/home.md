ATOMIUM is an accepted [ALMA](https://almascience.eso.org/) large program (ALMA id: 2018.1.00659.L) aiming at studying the wind of cool O-rich evolved stars. The project will also make use of other instruments and tools such as [VLT/SPHERE](https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/sphere.html), [VLTI/MATISSE](https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/matisse.html), [MERCATOR/HERMES](https://www.mercator.iac.es/instruments/hermes/), radiative transfer models, chemical networks, binary model.

The post-pipeline processed data for ATOMIUM can be found via [https://almascience.org/alma-data/lp/atomium](https://almascience.org/alma-data/lp/atomium). This comprises visibility data after self-calibration for each configuration (and the combined configurations), with the corresponding continuum images, line cubes and extracted spectra, including example scripts and descriptions.
